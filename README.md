# hello-world
This is my first repository on GitHub. Hello everyone!

Hello! I'm Patryk and I'm a future web developer. I focus on mastering front-end tools.
My aim is to get very fluent in use of front-end tools and to work remotely from a sandy beach somewehere in California or Thailand (actually, a beach and the sun are the only requirements...)!
Wish me luck!
